Then try the new Node.js package of IBM's Code Rally! Whether you are a complete Node Newbie, or an experienced Node veteran, test and hone your skills on the race track!\n\nThis repository is a portion of the Code Rally platform, used for building racing AIs and competing them against other developers in the cloud. The main purpose of this repository is to allow Node developers to construct their AIs in the language most familiar to them - JavaScript! It is supplemented by the Java-powered Code Rally server that powers the show and the Eclipse plugin which similarly lets developers build AIs using the Java language. \n\nFor more information, see the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/community/blogs/code-rally/entry/landing?lang=en\">Offical Code Rally Blog</a>!\n\n## Table of Contents\n\n1. [Installation](#installation)\n2. [Entering a Race](#entering-a-race)\n3. [Implementing a Car AI](#implementing-a-car-ai)\n4. [Examples](#examples)\n5. [Contributing](#contributing)\n6. [Other/Upcoming Features](#other-features)\n7. [History](#history)\n\n## Installation\n\nThere are two ways to get Code Rally (Node.js) running on your machine! Assuming that you have already <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://nodejs.org/en/\">Node.js</a> with NPM installed.\n\n1. Use `npm install git+https://git@github.com/WASdev/sample.coderally.nodeclient.git` at your Node application directory. Then `require('coderally-agent')`. You'll currently have to use the github URL until we finish our npm publish process.\n\n2. Clone this GitHub repository directly to your development directory. Then `require('./coderally-agent/index.js')`.\n\n## Getting Started\n\n### Entering a Race\n\n\tvar Agent = require('coderally-agent');\n\tvar myAgent = new Agent();\n\n\t...\n\n\tmyAgent.enterRace({\n\t\ttrack_id : \"0\",\n\t\tusername : \"karan_challenge_na\",\n\t\tuser_id : \"963\",\n\t\tuniqueUserid : \"116650285099720794308\", // OPTIONAL IF OAUTH DISABLED ON SERVER\n\t\tfile_name : \"Testcar\",\n\t\tvehicle_type: \"car_yellow\",\n\t\taccel : \"1\",\n\t\tweight : \"1\",\n\t\tarmor : \"0\",\n\t\ttraction : \"0\",\n\t\tturning : \"1\" \n\t}, 'challenge-na.coderallycloud.com');\n\n### Implementing a Car AI\n\n\tvar AIUtils = Agent.AIUtils;\n\n\t...\n\n\tmyAgent.on('onRaceStart', function (ourCar) {\n\t\tconsole.log(\"Race is starting\");\n\t\tprevPosition = ourCar.getCarStatus().getPosition();\n\n\t\t// Aggressive start\n\t\tvar target = AIUtils.getClosestLane(ourCar.getCarStatus().getCheckPoint(), ourCar.getCarStatus().getPosition());\n\t\tourCar.pushCarControl({\n\t\t\tcarBrakePercent : 0,\n\t\t\tcarAccelPercent : 100,\n\t\t\tcarTarget : target\n\t\t})\n\n\t});\n\n### Examples\n\nWe have code examples at hand to show your sample AIs in the `examples` folder.\n\n## Contributing\n\nCurrently contributed by IBM Canada's Node Enterprise Team with technical feedback and support by the Code Rally Team. Full credits for all support we've received can be seen below.\n\n## Upcoming Features\n\n### Interactive Code Editor\n\nWritten as an Express web application that utilizes this library. This feature allows you to write your code into the browser and enter your agent as a racer. Contains linting and allows for viewing logs during the race. Currently moved to a seperate repository that is undergoing open source process. Here are some previews:\n\n![Authenticate](pictures/CodeRally1.PNG) ![Code Edit](pictures/CodeRally2.PNG)\n\n### Video Viewing of Race\n\nImplemented and awaiting some fixes. Once you finish a race we will forward you to a URL which will let you view a video of your race. Here's a sneak peak at this feature: \n\n![Race Video](pictures/CodeRally3.PNG)\n\n### WebSocket compression\n\nWill be included in next release, by using the Node's `zlib` library we were able to deflate and inflate the outgoing and incoming messages accordingly. This will allow us to minimize the size of the messages that are sent between the Node client and the Code Rally server through their WebSocket connection. \n\n## History\n\n* [Jan 2016]\n  - Project Kickoff!\n  - Functional design drafted and approved\n  - GitHub Repository Created\n\n* [Feb 2016]\n  - Implemented Code Rally Node Module structure\n  - README.md v1.0.0\n  - Entering race functionality implemented \n  - Websocket support for updating race car in realtime\n\n* [Mar 2016]\n  - Built interactive code editor\n  - Added video viewing for race\n  - Started implementation of WebSocket Compression\n\n* [Apr 2016]\n  - Build 1.0.0 is open sourced and released\n  - Build 1.0.1 undergoing release process.\n\n## Credits\n\nKaran (S.)
